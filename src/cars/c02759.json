    "description": "Don't let the predefined body type here fool you, the Citela has the ability to transform into body types that shouldn't even be possible for a city car. To achieve such versatility, Citroen's engineers made the enitre body (which is made of plastic) detachable from the chassis, allowing for easy customization of the body. The Citela was certainly no slouch as an EV either with a range of 210km and the ability to last well over 100,000km throughout its life - incredible figures at the time. Too bad Citroen thought people weren't ready for this level of tech.",
