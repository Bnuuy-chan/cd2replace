    "description": "On paper the Porsche 911 R is a GT3 with a manual gearbox, the GT3 RSâ€™s engine and no wing. However, the philosophy behind the car is a little more involved than that. This is meant to be a really pure, emotive 911, a car that is about driver involvement on the road rather than the track.",
